# ESP32 Wearable Devices

This repository contains code for creating wearable devices using ESP32 microcontrollers. It includes examples and libraries for various sensors and actuators commonly used in wearable technology.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine and start experimenting with ESP32 wearable devices.

### Prerequisites

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install) installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.
- ESP32 development board.
- Wemos S2 Mini
- MS5611 (Barometric Pressure Sensor)
- GUVA S-12SD (UV Sensor)
- OLED / TFT Display (specific models may vary)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmaadfaauzn2/esp32_wearable_devices.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd esp32_wearable_devices
   ```

3. Open the project in PlatformIO:

   ```bash
   pio project open .
   ```

### Usage

1. Explore the `examples` directory to find sample projects demonstrating different functionalities of wearable devices.

2. Open an example project in PlatformIO.

3. Connect your ESP32 development board, Wemos S2 Mini, MS5611, GUVA S-12SD, and OLED / TFT Display to your computer as per the wiring instructions provided in the example code.

4. Build and upload the code to your ESP32 board using PlatformIO.

5. Once uploaded, you can monitor the serial output to see the device's behavior.
